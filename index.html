            <h2>About Cookies:</h2>
            <p>A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour,
                sugar and some
                type of oil or fat. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.

                In most English-speaking countries except for the United States and Canada, crisp cookies are called
                biscuits. Chewier
                biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in the United Kingdom. Some cookies may also be named by
                their shape, such
                as date squares or bars.

                Cookies or biscuits may be mass-produced in factories, made in small bakeries or homemade. Biscuit or
                cookie variants
                include sandwich biscuits, such as custard creams, Jammie Dodgers, Bourbons and Oreos, with marshmallow
                or jam filling
                and sometimes dipped in chocolate or another sweet coating. Cookies are often served with beverages such
                as milk, coffee
                or tea. Factory-made cookies are sold in grocery stores, convenience stores and vending machines.
                Fresh-baked cookies
                are sold at bakeries and coffeehouses, with the latter ranging from small business-sized establishments
                to multinational
                corporations such as Starbucks.</p>
            <p>Cookies are most commonly baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft, but some kinds of
                cookies are not
                baked at all. Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles, using an array of ingredients including
                sugars, spices,
                chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts, or dried fruits. The softness of the cookie may depend on how
                long it is baked.

                A general theory of cookies may be formulated this way. Despite its descent from cakes and other
                sweetened breads, the
                cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in cakes serves to
                make the base (in
                the case of cakes called "batter") as thin as possible, which allows the bubbles – responsible for a
                cake's
                fluffiness – to better form. In the cookie, the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil. Oils,
                whether they be in
                the form of butter, vegetable oils, or lard, are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a
                much higher
                temperature than water. Thus a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is far denser after
                removal from the oven.

                Oils in baked cakes do not behave as baking soda tends to in the finished result. Rather than
                evaporating and thickening
                the mixture, they remain, saturating the bubbles of escaped gases from what little water there might
                have been in the
                eggs, if added, and the carbon dioxide released by heating the baking powder. This saturation produces
                the most
                texturally attractive feature of the cookie, and indeed all fried foods: crispness saturated with a
                moisture (namely
                oil) that does not sink into it.</p>
